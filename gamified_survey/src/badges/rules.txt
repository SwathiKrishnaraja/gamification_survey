They used 10 badges for different achievements. I have summarized the logic that determines when a badge is awarded as follows:
1. When one starts the survey (Let's go!)
2. When one reaches 33% of the overall questions (33% Achieved)
3. When 66% of the questions answered ( 66% Achieved)
4. After reaching the last page of the survey (Almost Done!)
5. After answering questions on the last page (Interview)
6. Completed the survey (Won!)
7. Answered all questions including open questions ( Full Score)
8. Takes at least 3 minutes to complete each survey page (Tactician!)
9. Collect all badges ( Media Collector)
10. Find the mascot (Audience favorite)
